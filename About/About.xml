Allows for the building shield generators. Shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it but allow weapons to be fired out.  This includes bullets, rockets, mortar rounds, pods of **any** variety (enemies via drop pods, cargo pods, escape pods, and yes, **your** pods).  Shields have low idle power use and high power usage when stopping projectiles.  Shield strength is determined from stored battery power.  More batteries equals more protection.

**Features:**
- Existing save compatible
- Stop projectiles (bullets, rockets, grenades, mortars, drop pods)
- Shields use a small amount of idle power
- Shield strength is the stored energy on your power net
- Shields generators will heat up as the shields absorb damage and will shut off if they overheat
- Shields come in three sizes:
- small (3m)
- medium (3m - 10m)
- large (5m - 25m)
- The small shield is minifiable and portable and contains an internal battery (1000 Wd, 50% efficient)
- Larger shields can soak more heat before the shield collapses

**Shields Don't:**
- Stop movement of pawns in or out of the shields
- Stop fires
- Heal people
- Stop fires from explosions from propagating into the shield (Tip: don't stand near the edge if the bad guy has an incendiary launcher)

**Compatibility:**
- No known mod conflicts

**Optionally Supported Mods:**
- Combat Extended (CE): Use the CE support expansion
- RedistHeat: Cool shields with ducts
